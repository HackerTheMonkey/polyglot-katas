# Polyglot Code Katas implementations
The purpose of this project is to explore various aspects of a given set of programming languages and get used to their syntax. As the best way of learning is learning by doing, here I am attempting to solve the same problem/code kata in multiple programming languages.

###### Suggested Programming langauges
1. Java - (the reference implementation)
2. Groovy
3. Ruby
4. Scala
5. Bash
6. Javascript
7. GO
8. C++
9. Swift
10. Clojure
11. Pony

_Note:_ Other programming langauges can be added where it seems appropriate to do so.
